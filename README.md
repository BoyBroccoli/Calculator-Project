# Calculator-Project
I tried a mini project creating a Calculator but having issues linking my CSS to my HTML File and could use some help :)
I'm unsure as to why the CSS wont link with the HTML file, (i'm a beginner), and tried a simple project from this site https://thecodingpie.com/post/how-to-build-a-simple-calculator-using-javascript-html-and-css
I could use any advice, thanks in advance
